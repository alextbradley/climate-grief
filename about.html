<h1>About</h1>

<p>
      The Climate Grief Project a collaboration between scientists and artists, to produce spaces and experiences where people can process the grief associated with climate-related loss. <br/><br/> 

       -- <br><br>

       Despite unequivocal evidence of the increasing, existential threat of climate change, responses remain insufficient. One major factor is the difficulty of engaging meaningfully with climate change: its causes and impacts are diffuse, globally distributed, and deeply interconnected, rather than from a single source or affecting a single location. As a result, climate change can be difficult to comprehend not only intellectually, but emotionally. <br/>
<br/> <br/>At the same time, losses of ecosystems, species, and natural environments are widespread. However, there are few spaces where people can acknowledge and process the grief associated with these losses. This project explores how creative practice can support deeper emotional engagement with climate change and climate-related loss. <br/>
<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will explore how climate data - the primary medium through which the scientific community communicates climate change - can be translated into immersive creative experiences that foster emotional understanding among audiences. <br/>
<br/><br/>The overarching objective is to facilitate meaningful connections with climate action through the data underpinning climate change, while providing a reflective, supportive spaces for audiences to engage with, interpret, and grieve climate-related loss.
